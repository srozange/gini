# Gini
Gini is an ultra light dependency injection and AOP engine.

Beans managed by Gini are singletons only, they are injected by type, then by field name if several candidates for injection are found.

AOP allows to intercept method calls on managed beans. In order to do so, Gini uses [CGLib](https://github.com/cglib/cglib) to create dynamic proxies.

###  Interface IStep
```java
public interface IStep {

	String getImplemName();

}
```
###  Class StepImpl1

We use the @Managed annotation to declare bean as managed by Gini.

```java
@Managed
public class StepImpl1 implements IStep {

	@Override
	public String getImplemName() {
		return "stepImpl1";
	}
}
```

###  Class StepImpl2

```java
@Managed
public class StepImpl2 implements IStep {

	@Override
	public String getImplemName() {
		return "stepImpl2";
	}
}
```

###  Injected class

Fields in need for injection must be annotated with the @Inject annotation.

```java
@Managed
public class Root {
	
	@Inject
	private IStep stepImpl1;
	
	@Inject
	private IStep stepImpl2;
	
	public IStep getStep1()  {
		return stepImpl1;
	}
	
	public IStep getStep2()  {
		return stepImpl2;
	}
}
```

###  Let's try it out

```java
GiniContext ctx = new GiniContext("org.theglump.gini.example");
Root root = ctx.getBean(Root.class);

System.out.println(root.getStep1().getImplemName());
>> stepImpl1

System.out.println(root.getStep2().getImplemName());
>> stepImpl2
```

## AOP example

###  Advice

An advice must be annotated with the @Advice annotation, it's composed of methods annotated with the @Around annotation, those are executed during method interceptions.

Target methods are defined with a joinpoint (property of the @Around annotation). A joinpoint is a regular expression matching method patterns of form *package.class.method*.

```java
@Advice
public class Advice {

	@Around(joinpoint = ".*IStep.getImplemName")
	public String intercept(Object bean, Method method, Object[] args, MethodInvoker methodInvoker) {
		return "intercepted => " + methodInvoker.invokeMethod(args);
	}
}
```

###  Let's try it out

```java
GiniContext ctx = new GiniContext("org.theglump.gini.example");
Root root = ctx.getBean(Root.class);

System.out.println(root.getStep1().getImplemName());
>> intercepted => stepImpl1

System.out.println(root.getStep2().getImplemName());
>> intercepted => stepImpl2
```
